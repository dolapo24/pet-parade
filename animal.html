                <p><strong>Name: Tyler</strong> The 3,000-year-old Xoloitzcuintli (pronounced "show-low-eats-QUEENT-lee"), the ancient Aztec dog of the gods, is today a loving companion and vigilant watchdog. The alert and loyal Xolo comes in three sizes, and in either hairless or coated varieties. ¿The Xoloitzcuintli (show-low-eats-queen-tlee) comes in three sizes (toy, miniature, and standard), and two varieties (hairless and coated). The hairless has tough, smooth, close-fitting skin. The coated variety is covered by a short, flat coat. Both varieties come in dark colors, ranging from black, gray-black, slate, to red, liver, or bronze. The face is thoughtful and intelligent, and a Xolo's forehead will wrinkle when he's deep in thought. The Xolo's graceful, elegant body is surprisingly strong and rugged.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: savage </strong> Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose 'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. These docile, loyal companions adapt well to town or country. 

                    You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'¿Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: Husky</strong> The Basenji, Africa's 'Barkless Dog,' is a compact, sweet-faced hunter of intelligence and poise. They are unique and beguiling pets, best for owners who can meet their exercise needs and the challenge of training this catlike canine. Basenjis are small, graceful hounds standing 16 or 17 inches at the shoulder. They are recognizable by their glistening short coat, tightly curled tail, and wrinkled forehead and expressive almond-shaped eyes that convey a variety of subtle, humanlike emotions. Basenjis are a lovely sight at a standstill but more impressive yet at a fast trot, when they exhibit the long, smooth strides of a mini-racehorse. And yes, it's true, they don't bark, but they make their feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel. Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a 'cult breed''¿small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: spyro</strong> The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside world with a self-assured aloofness. A male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter. The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength. A thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait. A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he's not a toy breed, so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: kaira</strong> The ragdoll breeding process involved careful selection for gentle, non-aggressive traits. As time went on, Baker had increasingly eccentric ideas about the ragdoll breed—at one point, she even claimed the breed was the result of medically altered genetics, although that claim is unfounded. The ragdoll was recognized as a purebred cat in 1965.

                    Breeders who were franchised under Baker eventually distanced themselves due to increasing strain with Baker. But they continued breeding the adorable, docile cats we know and love today.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: Simba</strong> The American bobtail we know today began naturally, with feral domestic cats born with bobbed tails, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association. One of the first known instances of attempted breeding was in the 1960s when a vacationing couple, John and Brenda Sanders, found a bobtail cat in Arizona and let him mate with their female cat back home in Iowa.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: Furball</strong> The merican curl was first created in 1981 in Lakewood, Calif., according to the CFA. A pair of stray kittens appeared on the doorstep of Joe and Grace Ruga in June of that year, both of whom looked like typical domestic cats, with the exception of their ears, which were curled backward on their heads. The Rugas took the pair in, though one disappeared again shortly thereafter. The remaining cat—a black longhair the Rugas named Shulamith—became the basis upon which the new breed was created, and back to which every American curl today can trace their lineage.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: Manx</strong> The Manx has existed for centuries on the Isle of Man. While their exact origin is a matter of some debate, they were almost certainly created when a cat with a spontaneous short-tailed mutation was introduced to the island, most likely by either Nordic or Spanish sailors. Due to the island's small size and relative isolation from the mainland, combined with the mutation's high degree of penetration, the Manx gene became the dominant trait among the island's cat population.</p>

                <p><strong>Name: Coco</strong> Eclectus parrots live in tropical rainforests and originated in the Solomon Islands. Wild populations also live in northeastern Australia, Indonesian, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. Its name "eclectus" is derived from the word "eclectic" since the male and female species look so different.</p>

In this sense the name is given to some 115 species in 30 genera of the subfamily Psittacinae (family Psittacidae) and has influenced another parrot name, lorikeet (see parrot).</p>

It has a preference for nesting high in tree hollows and generally travels in small flocks of 30 or so birds. The word "jenday" comes from Old Tupi, the indigenous language from Brazil.</p>
